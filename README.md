# mockbot
Annoy other users on twitter dot com

This is a shitty twitter bot in python3 to be triggered by a cronjob or manually. Since I am obviously not proficient in python, don't expect anything at all. #worksforme

To get started you need to:
* Create a twitter.cfg with your API keys (just copy sample_twitter.cfg)
* Create a victims.txt with the users you want to piss off (just copy sample_victims.txt)
* Provide a mock.jpg which will be included in every tweet.
